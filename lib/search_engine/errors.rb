    #
    # Examples: DNS resolution failures, refused TCP connections, TLS handshake
    # errors, or other socket-level errors.

    # constructed an invalid request (e.g., blank collection name).

    # Typical cause: a typo or using a field that is not declared via
    # {SearchEngine::Base.attribute}.
    class InvalidField < Error; end

    # declared on the model.

    # grammar accepted by the Parser.

    # when its shape is incompatible (e.g., empty array for IN/NOT IN).
    class InvalidType < Error; end

    # Raised when a requested join association is not declared for a model.
    #
    # Typical cause: a typo or referencing an association that has not been
    # registered via {SearchEngine::Base.join}.

    # be declared via {SearchEngine::Base.join}.

    # suggestions ("did you mean ..."), while keeping {UnknownJoin} for
    # lower-level registry lookups.

    # the association on the relation via {SearchEngine::Relation#joins}.

    # `.joins(:authors)` on the relation first.

    # Raised when a nested attribute referenced by the Field Selection DSL is
    # not declared on the joined association's target model.
    #
    # Typical cause: a typo in a nested field name or a stale attribute map.

    # Raised when selection inputs are malformed or ambiguous and cannot be
    # deterministically normalized (e.g., invalid nested shapes or incompatible
    # payload types).

    # Raised when grouping DSL is used with invalid inputs.
    #
    # Use for actionable messages like unknown field names, invalid limit values,
    # or non-boolean missing_values.
    #
    # @example Unknown field with suggestion
    #   raise SearchEngine::Errors::InvalidGroup, "InvalidGroup: unknown field :brand for grouping on SearchEngine::Product (did you mean :brand_id?)"
    class InvalidGroup < Error; end

    # Raised when grouping references unsupported constructs such as joined/path fields
    # (e.g., "$assoc.field"). Only base fields are supported for grouping.
    #
    # @example
    #   raise SearchEngine::Errors::UnsupportedGroupField, 'UnsupportedGroupField: grouping supports base fields only (got "$authors.last_name")'
    class UnsupportedGroupField < Error; end

    # Raised when strict selection is enabled and a requested field is absent
    # in the hydrated document (e.g., excluded by API mapping).
    #
    # This error is actionable and guides remediation: adjust the relation's
    # selection (select/exclude/reselect), relax strictness, or ensure the
    # upstream Typesense include/exclude mapping includes the fields.
    class MissingField < Error; end

    # Raised when a materializer requests fields that are not permitted by the
    # relation's effective selection (include âˆ’ exclude, with exclude taking precedence).
    #
    # Used by selection-aware materializers like {SearchEngine::Relation#pluck}
    # and {SearchEngine::Relation#ids} to fail fast before any network call.
    class InvalidSelection < Error; end

    # Raised when curated ID does not match the configured pattern.
    #
    # @see docs/curation.md
    # @example
    #   raise SearchEngine::Errors::InvalidCuratedId, 'InvalidCuratedId: "foo bar" is not a valid curated ID. Expected pattern: /\A[\w\-:\.]+\z/. Try removing illegal characters.'
    class InvalidCuratedId < Error; end

    # Raised when pinned/hidden lists exceed configured limits after normalization.
    #
    # @see docs/curation.md
    # @example
    #   raise SearchEngine::Errors::CurationLimitExceeded, 'CurationLimitExceeded: pinned list exceeds max_pins=50 (attempted 51). Reduce inputs or raise the limit in SearchEngine.config.curation.'
    class CurationLimitExceeded < Error; end

    # Raised when an override tag is blank or invalid per allowed pattern.
    #
    # @see docs/curation.md
    # @example
