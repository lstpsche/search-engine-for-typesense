module SearchEngine
  # Test-only utilities for offline execution and assertions.
  #
  # Provides:
  # - SearchEngine::Test::StubClient â€” a programmable stub client that captures requests
  # - Event capture helpers (SearchEngine::Test.capture_events)
  # - Framework adapters (RSpec matcher `emit_event`, Minitest assertions)
  #
  # These helpers are allocation-light, thread-safe, and never perform network I/O.
